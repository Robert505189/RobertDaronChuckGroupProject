I posted the last udates to the code I plan on doing. I think All the bugs are out that will cause run time failures
so anything past that would be nit picking which there is no longer time for. Daron has start the word doc and I will be writting the pseudocode for it and post it here we also need the UML diagrams made since there will not be any more changes to the code we can finish the word doc and submit tonight.
